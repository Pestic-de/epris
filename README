= This is epris, your small audio player! =

Unlike xmms2 or mpd, it uses GStreamer and DBus.
It is written in Vala.

`epr` is the command line client.

`epris` is the D-Bus service, you don't have to run it manually, it
will start and shutdown automatically.

It is based on excellent GStreamer `playbin2`. And it supports *gap-less* playback! (or almost)

== Build dependency ==

 * GStreamer > 0.10

 * dbus-glib-1 > 0.70

If you want to build the from the vala (not from a distribution tarball):

 * Vala > 0.7.4 + custom patch (from bugzilla...)

The code is hosted on [http://gitorious.org/projects/epris Gitorious]:
{{{
git clone git://gitorious.org/epris/mainline.git
}}}

== Why? ==

Epris name come from MPRIS, the Media Player Remote Interface
Specification. Unfortunately, I didn't like it so much, and I started
to have disdain for it ("avoir du mepris" in french).

However, writing Epris could help me to help improve future versions
of MPRIS.

Being not satisfied by the monolithic, itune-like, player, or any of
the xmms2 or mpd player, I couldn't resist to do my own small
service.

"Epris", because _all you need is love_...
